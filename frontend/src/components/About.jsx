            <p>Welcome to  Terra! We're a dedicated group of developers and enthusiasts passionate about leveraging technology to explore and visualise interesting statistics from around the world.</p>
            <p className = "title">WHAT IS TERRA?</p>
            <p>Terra is a collaborative effort by our team to create an innovative web application that visualises a wide range of statistics. Our goal is to provide users with a platform to explore and analyse diverse datasets, fostering curiosity and informed decision-making.</p>
