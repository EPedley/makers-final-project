        <p><strong>About Us</strong></p>
        <p>Welcome to  Terra! We're a dedicated group of developers and enthusiasts passionate about leveraging technology to explore and visualise interesting statistics from around the world.</p>
        <p><strong>What is Terra?</strong></p>
        <p>Terra is a collaborative effort by our team to create an innovative web application that visualises a wide range of statistics. Our goal is to provide users with a platform to explore and analyse diverse datasets, fostering curiosity and informed decision-making.</p>
        <p><strong>Our Inspiration</strong></p>
        <p>The idea for Terra stemmed from our collective curiosity about the world and a desire to make data more accessible and engaging. We recognised the power of visualisation in uncovering insights and sparking meaningful conversations, driving us to develop Terra as a versatile tool for exploration.</p>
        <p><strong>Project Highlights</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Diverse Data Visualisation: Terra offers heat chats and heat maps to allow for interactive visualisations. Our platform allows users to explore a variety of datasets with ease, uncovering trends and correlations across different domains.</li>
          {/* <li>Expansion into New Data Types: As part of our ongoing development efforts, we're expanding Terra's capabilities to include a broader range of data types. In addition to environmental metrics, users can expect to find statistics on crime rates, agricultural yields, population demographics, and more.</li> */}
